"""
Chordal development and processing. TTC operates the chordal mode on an entire tonerow at a time.
All chords share the the property that the interval
between adjacent pitches is either a perfect consonant (the perfect 4th = 5i) or an imperfect
consonant (major and minor thirds, i.e., 4i or 3i).
Chordal modes (Group) from the config file are 1, 2, 3 as described in the 12ToneChords.pdf
The other two options are 'R' to randomly choose one of the three groups or 'N' for none in which case this function will not be called.
